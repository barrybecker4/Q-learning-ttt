/** The lake configuration.
  * The FrozenLake environment consists of a M1 x M2 grid of blocks,
  * each one either the start block, the goal block, a safe frozen block, or a dangerous hole.
  * The objective is to learn to navigate from the start to the goal without falling nto a hole.
  * At any given time the agent can choose to move either up, down, left, or right.
  * A wind occasionally blows the agent onto a space they didnâ€™t choose, making perfect performance impossible.
  * Learning to avoid the holes and reach the goal are still doable.
  * The reward for steps where you survive is 0, die is -1, and reach the goal is 1.
  * @param numRows width of the lake in blocks
  * @param numColumns length of the length in blocks
  * @param start initial starting point of the agent
  * @param goal reward of 1 when you reach the goal
  * @param holes set of holes in the ice. If you land on one, you fall in and die. Reward of -1
  * @param windFrequency a number between 0 and 1. The frequency with which the wind blows and moves you a random
  *                      direction on each attempted movement.
