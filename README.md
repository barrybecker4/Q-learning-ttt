# Q-learning

 [Q-Learning](https://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-0-q-learning-with-tables-and-neural-networks-d195264329d0) is a strategy for reinforcement learning.
 This project is a generic Q-learning library that can be applied to a variety of domains.
 
 An example implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe is provided that shows how Q-learning can be used to let the computer learn to play optimally against a human.
 Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game with only a few thousand possible states (fewer if you account for symmetry). 
 For domains where the domains are much greater, some sort of appxroximation to the actual set of states can be used - 
 like a neural net for example.
